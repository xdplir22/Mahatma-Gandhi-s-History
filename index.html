        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, and died on January 30, 1948, in Delhi. He was a prominent Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who led the nationalist movement against British rule in India. Gandhi is known for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress. He is widely revered as the father of his country and was internationally acclaimed during his lifetime and after his death.</p>
        <h2>Youth</h2>
        <p>Gandhi was the youngest child of his father’s fourth wife. His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. He was, however, an able administrator who knew how to steer his way between the capricious princes, their long-suffering subjects, and the headstrong British political officers in power.

            Gandhi’s mother, Putlibai, was completely absorbed in religion, did not care much for finery or jewelry, divided her time between her home and the temple, fasted frequently, and wore herself out in days and nights of nursing whenever there was sickness in the family. Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal. Thus, he took for granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between adherents of various creeds and sects.
